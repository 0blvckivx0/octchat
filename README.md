# octrachat test

a terminal wallet reminiscent of dos-era tui interfaces — but built with modern asynchronous architecture

## what it does
- private chat via ephemeral key gen
- shows your octra wallet balance and tx history  
- lets you send one or many transactions  
- exports your private key or full wallet file
